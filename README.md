**Portfolio Build Requirement: Angular**

**Objective:**
Create a dynamic portfolio website for a software developer using Angular framework. The portfolio should showcase the developer's profile, provide an 'About Us' section, and detail various projects undertaken, along with their descriptions.

**Requirements:**

1. **Profile Page:**
   - Display the developer's name, profile picture, and a brief bio.
   - Include links to the developer's resume/CV and contact information.

2. **About Us Page:**
   - Provide a detailed overview of the developer's skills, expertise, and experience.
   - Highlight academic qualifications, certifications, and any relevant achievements.
   - Optionally, include a timeline showcasing career milestones.

3. **Projects Page:**
   - List all projects undertaken by the developer.
   - Each project entry should include:
     - Project name
     - Brief description
     - Technologies used
     - Date of completion
     - Link to the project (if available)
   - Projects should be categorizable (e.g., by technology stack, industry, etc.).

4. **Portfolio Layout:**
   - Utilize Angular Material or custom CSS for a modern and responsive design.
   - Ensure consistent navigation across all pages with a header and footer.
   - Implement smooth page transitions and animations for enhanced user experience.
   - Use routing to navigate between different sections/pages seamlessly.

5. **Dynamic Content:**
   - Content on all pages should be easily updatable through a CMS (Content Management System) or editable JSON files.
   - Implement lazy loading for images and content to optimize performance.

6. **Contact Page:**
   - Include a contact form for visitors to reach out to the developer.
   - Optionally, integrate with third-party services like Google Forms or Formspree for form submissions.
   - Display social media links for professional networking (e.g., LinkedIn, GitHub).

7. **SEO and Analytics:**
   - Implement SEO best practices for better visibility on search engines.
   - Integrate Google Analytics or similar tools to track website traffic and user interactions.

8. **Responsive Design:**
   - Ensure the website is fully responsive and compatible with various devices and screen sizes (desktops, tablets, smartphones).

9. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Optimize website loading speed by minifying CSS/JS files and leveraging Angular's built-in performance optimization techniques.

**Timeline:**
- **Week 1-2:** Requirements Gathering and Initial Setup
- **Week 3-4:** Frontend Development (Profile, About Us, Projects Pages)
- **Week 5-6:** Backend Integration (Contact Form, CMS Integration)
- **Week 7-8:** Testing and Debugging
- **Week 9:** SEO Implementation and Analytics Integration
- **Week 10:** Final Review and Deployment

**Note:** This timeline is tentative and may vary based on project complexity and developer availability.

**Deliverables:**
- Angular project source code.
- Detailed documentation covering setup instructions, usage guide, and any additional notes.
- Deployed and live portfolio website on a hosting platform (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, Firebase).

**Additional Considerations:**
- Ensure adherence to web accessibility standards (WCAG) for inclusivity.
- Implement version control (e.g., Git) for collaborative development and code management.
- Regular communication and feedback sessions between the developer and stakeholders for iterative improvements.
